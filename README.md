## Hi 👋 

I'm [**Haydar Amru**](https://github.com/haydaramru), obsessed with tinkering (me vs rabbit hole) and diving into **projects** that solve "interesting" problems.

I'm open for a spot in a forward-thinking community where I can sharpen skills through hands-on training. Let's connect and explore opportunities together!🤝
